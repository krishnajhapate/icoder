    <h3><span id="Understanding_Color_Theory"><strong>Understanding&nbsp; Color Theory</strong></span></h3>
    <p>The initial step is to understand the basics of color theory. So what is color theory? It is a guide of combining
        colors that have existed in different eras like the Renaissance and Baroque. . It is based on the principle of
        lightness, hue, and chroma.</p>
    <p>These elements come together to create a mood or emotion. There are no hard rules but there are some basics in
        the theory that define how the colors blend and their emotions.</p>
    <h3><span id="The_Color_Wheel"><strong>The Color Wheel</strong></span></h3>
    <p>In 1666, Sir Isaac Newton created the first circular diagram of colors. Since then, the color wheel has played a
        vital role in understanding hues. It is impressive to note that color wheels are used by everyone, from
        designers, artists to elementary art students.</p>
    <h3><span id="The_Traditional_Color_System_developed_by_Munsell">The Traditional Color System developed by
            Munsell</span></h3>
    <p>Albert H. Munsell first developed the traditional color theory. Over the years, it has become more refined and
        precise. The color theory divides colors into the following categories:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary </strong>&ndash; According to Munsell, there are three primary colors &ndash; red, yellow,
            and blue. These are called the primary colors because every other color can be derived by mixing them, but
            the reverse is not possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary </strong>&ndash; The trio of green, orange, and purple create secondary colors. These are
            obtained by mixing the primary colors.</li>
        <li><strong>Tertiary</strong> &ndash; When you mix a primary color with a secondary color, you get the tertiary
            colors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span id="The_RGB_and_CMYK_Color_Systems"><strong>The RGB and CMYK Color Systems</strong></span></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>RGB &ndash; As the name suggests, the primary colors are red, green, and blue. RGB is mostly used for mobile
            screens, monitors, televisions, and other electronic displays.</li>
        <li>CMYK &ndash; Here, the primary colors are cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. CMYK is mostly used for
            printing.</li>
    </ul>

        blue are the primary colors.</p>
    <h3><span id="Color_Schemes"><strong>Color Schemes&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>
    <p>When you are creating a video, it is essential to select colors that visually appeal to your viewers. Now, you
        can rely on an online pastel color guide or a color palette selector. However, to get the best results, you must
        learn the functioning of the color schemes.</p>
    <p>It is advisable to avoid oversaturated and bright colors, as they can ruin the mood. You also need to ensure that
        your texts are explicit and do not blend into the background. For all these things, you need a comprehensive
        understanding of color schemes. Here are some of the most common approaches &ndash;</p>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Complementary Colors</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Shades that are opposite to each other on the color wheel are complementary colors. For example, sky blue and
        orange, yellow and blue are some of the common combinations. Complementary shades work well because they
        contrast each other without being too chaotic.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Analogous Colors</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are the colors that are close to each other. This is a harmonious combination that is well balanced and
        visually appealing. For example, blue, purple, and pink or red, orange, and yellow are common analogous
        combinations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monochromatic</strong></li>
        <li>A monochromatic tone is a trendy color scheme. This combination consists of a single base color along with
            the shade and tint of the same color. For example, blue as the base, sky blue as the tint, and navy blue as
            the shade.</li>
        <li>One of the reasons why Monochromatic shades are so popular is because they are soothing and balance each
            other very well.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Cool and Warm</li>
        <li>You can divide the whole color wheel into two sections &ndash; Warm and Cool. The warm colors are the red
            and yellow shades, whereas the cool consists of blue and green hues. You can always use a combination of
            cold and warm colors as they go well with each other. Yet, make sure not to choose excessive shades as it
            can cause a blunder. Keep it minimal and elegant!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are various color schemes out there, but these are the most common ones.</p>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <h3><span id="Why_Is_Color_Important"><strong>Why Is Color Important?</strong></span></h3>
    <p>When you work on video marketing, you aim to sell your product by either focusing on the need or making viewers
        feel good about your service. Ultimately, you are trying to invoke emotions, and that is where colors play a
        quintessential role.</p>
    <p>Based on psychology, it is proven that colors do influence emotion and energy. For example, warm colors like red
        and yellow reflect power, happiness, and sunshine. While in other parts of the world, red depicts evil, and
        yellow represents sickness. Similarly, the cool colors are considered to have a calming effect on the senses.
        They depict freedom. However,&nbsp; blue is also coldness, lack of emotion, and dullness.</p>
    <p>So, it is crucial to understand your audience and your geography. Then, select the color accordingly. While
        creating a video, it is advisable to use cool colors in your background and warm ones as your highlights.</p>
